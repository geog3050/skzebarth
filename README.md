# Samuel Taylor 

## GEOG:5055 - Geoprogramming.


### Purpose:
This repository houses all code generated from the University of Iowa's Geoprogramming course under Dr. Caglar Koylu.

### Student Background:
Samuel Taylor is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences. Samuel is passionate about using various forms of remotely sensed data to create new methodological approaches to improve our understanding of global phenomena. He hopes to use this research to better protect humans from climate change disasters. Samuel is currently researching harmful algal bloom development and detection with hyperspectral products and machine learning approaches to better understand and predict the risk communities face. Samuel's previous research examined wildfire burn severity with multispectral and hyperspectral imagery to determine post-fire debris-flow probability. Through this research, he developed new methods for assessing debris flow risk. Looking towards the future, Samuel hopes to combine his passion for research and teaching as a professor in the sciences. At home, Samuel and his wife, Emily, are excitedly preparing to be new parents, and when he gets free time, he loves playing guitar and hanging with the boys.
